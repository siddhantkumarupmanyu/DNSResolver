=============================================================

change address from int to bytes as it can be cname or better change it to String,

add timeout in Network manager so other requests are made if one blocked executor for response but it never arrived

Add support for CNAME and NS in DNSPacket
    -DNSPacketParser should support CNAME with current code, but i have to do a unit test to be sure
    -i do not know what kind of special support do NS need apart from what i already have in DNSPacket

add noRandomId Arg to main; if it's given id will always be 1;
    - it will be useful in testing but it production. No need to give this arg and a random id will be used
    - add a random id generator; only unit testing it will be enough; no need to end to end test it.

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check to see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

nextByte() in DNSPacketParser can be replace with an iterator.
    -but nextByte gives more readability, so let it remain
