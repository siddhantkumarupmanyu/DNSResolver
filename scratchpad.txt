no need to match id's in end to end test. - fix these tests

DNSPacketParser: refactor ParseQuery and ParseAnswers have duplications

PacketGenerator and PacketParser should go into network packages as they are used by network manager only,
    - also PacketFormatter should go into ui package;

add timeout in Network manager so other requests are made if one blocked executor for response but it never arrived

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check to see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

nextByte() in DNSPacketParser can be replace with an iterator.
    -but nextByte gives more readability, so let it remain

can extract queries and its associated methods to a inner class in DNSResolver.
    - but I think, not needed now. If I touch this class again I will do it.
