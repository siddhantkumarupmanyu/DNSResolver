    -requires support for NS

=============================================================

no need to match id's in end to end test.
    -Should use Arrays.copyOf() to neglect first two bytes;

DNSPacketParser: refactor ParseQuery and ParseAnswers have duplications

PacketGenerator and PacketParser should go into network packages as they are used by network manager only,
    - also PacketFormatter should go into ui package;

add timeout in Network manager so other requests are made if one blocked executor for response but it never arrived

Add support for NS in DNSPacket
    -i do not know what kind of special support do NS need apart from what i already have in DNSPacket

add noRandomId Arg to main; if it's given id will always be 1;
    - it will be useful in testing but it production. No need to give this arg and a random id will be used
    - add a random id generator; only unit testing it will be enough; no need to end to end test it.

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check to see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

nextByte() in DNSPacketParser can be replace with an iterator.
    -but nextByte gives more readability, so let it remain
