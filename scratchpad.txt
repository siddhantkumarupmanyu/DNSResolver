single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain


=============================================================

DNSMessage -> has DNSProtocol + DNSSocketAddress
                DNSProtocol -> specifies all DNS protocol Related stuff

i would definitely have to use builder for DNSProtocol, but let's wait till i actually start using it.

since fakeServerThread and DNSThread is mostly same
there should be a generic name for it.... Like NetworkThread yeah NetworkThread
rename DNSThread to NetworkThread and replace fakeServerThread with NetworkThread

replace ip and port pair with dns socket everywhere in tests too

instead of using string create a DNS domain Value type; DNSMessage
