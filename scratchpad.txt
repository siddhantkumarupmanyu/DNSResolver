single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain


=============================================================

DNSAnswer should take byte[] for address not int

Change NetworkManager name to something more suitable

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check ot see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

I have to do something with the exceptions
    -exceptions are in DatagramPacketTransceiver
    -also main have many exceptions but they will disappear as we improve the design

nextByte() in parse can be replace with an iterator.
    -but nextByte gives more readability, so let it remain

Add support for CNAME and NS in DNSPacket
    -i do not know what kind of special support do they need apart from what i already have in DNSPacket
    -DNSPacketParser should support CNAME with current code, but i have to do a unit test to be sure
