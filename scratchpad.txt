single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain

DNSPacket -> specifies all DNS protocol Related stuff
    i would definitely have to use builder for DNSPacket, but let's wait till i actually start using it.

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check ot see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

I have to do something with the exceptions
    -exceptions are mostly in Network thread
    -one exception is in DNSSocketAddress, but only network thread will call InetAddress method so,
        we can handle that
    -also main have many exceptions but they will disappear as we improve the design


Add support for CNAME and NS in DNSPacket
