single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain


=============================================================

since fakeServerThread and DNSThread is mostly same
there should be a generic name for it.... Like NetworkThread yeah NetworkThread
rename DNSThread to NetworkThread and replace fakeServerThread with NetworkThread

replace ip and port pair with dns socket everywhere in tests too

instead of using string create a DNS domain Value type; DNSMessage
