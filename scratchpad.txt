how should I get socketAddress from PacketTransceiver.receivePacket()

UDPPacketTransceiver will suffer concurrency problems when queries starts executing parallel
    -i.e now DatagramPacketTransceiver depends on implementation of Network manager to work effectively
    -it's so a we are only creating socket when sending data and closing it when receiving.
    -if in between we re called sendPacket the previous socket will be gone, yielding unexpected results.
    -there is coupling between DatagramPacketTransceiver and NetworkManager; fix this
    -we need other class in DatagramPacketTransceiver that will manage the sockets for each query. (hint: use map)

Change NetworkManager name to something more suitable

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check ot see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

nextByte() in DNSPacketParser can be replace with an iterator.
    -but nextByte gives more readability, so let it remain

Add support for CNAME and NS in DNSPacket
    -DNSPacketParser should support CNAME with current code, but i have to do a unit test to be sure
    -i do not know what kind of special support do NS need apart from what i already have in DNSPacket
