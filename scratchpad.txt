single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain


=============================================================

how should I get socketAddress from PacketTransceiver.response()

Change NetworkManager name to something more suitable

Add isValid method in DNSPacket
    -builder should call isValid()
    -isValid method should check ot see of All RRs matches as specified by their counts

nextByte() in DNSPacketParser can be replace with an iterator.
    -but nextByte gives more readability, so let it remain

Add support for CNAME and NS in DNSPacket
    -DNSPacketParser should support CNAME with current code, but i have to do a unit test to be sure
    -i do not know what kind of special support do NS need apart from what i already have in DNSPacket
