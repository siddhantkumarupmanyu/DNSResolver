single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain


=============================================================

NetworkThread should send and receive DNSProtocol instead of message inside DNSProtocol

call stopThread when application exits

DNSProtocol -> specifies all DNS protocol Related stuff
    i would definitely have to use builder for DNSProtocol, but let's wait till i actually start using it.

I have to do something with the exceptions
    -exceptions are mostly in Network thread
    -one exception is in DNSSocketAddress, but only network thread will call InetAddress method so,
        we can handle that
    -also main have many exceptions but they will disappear as we improve the design
