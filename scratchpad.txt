single resolver, valid domain

multiple resolvers, valid domain


=============================================================

NetworkThread should send and receive DNSExchange instead of message inside DNSExchange
    -we only need DNSExchange fields bytes in order they declared, but java serialization adds a lot of other stuff

DNSExchange -> specifies all DNS protocol Related stuff
    i would definitely have to use builder for DNSExchange, but let's wait till i actually start using it.

Add isValid method in DNSExchange
    -builder should call isValid()

I have to do something with the exceptions
    -exceptions are mostly in Network thread
    -one exception is in DNSSocketAddress, but only network thread will call InetAddress method so,
        we can handle that
    -also main have many exceptions but they will disappear as we improve the design

length of byte buffer to be given to receiving datagram packet.
    -DNSExchange should have something called DNSHeader which is always of constant length
    -And DNSBody which can vary
    -See if this kind of specification  exist in Dns Protocol
    -Also if there isn't we should specify the max length in receiving datagram
    -and check DNSExchange if it isValid()
